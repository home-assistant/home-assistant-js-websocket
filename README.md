# :aerial_tramway: JavaScript websocket client for Home Assistant

This is a websocket client written in JavaScript that communicates with the Home Assistant websocket API. It can be used to integrate Home Assistant into your apps. It has 0 dependencies.

```javascript
import { createConnection, subscribeEntities } from 'home-assistant-js-websocket';

function stateChanged(event) {
  console.log('state changed', event);
}

createConnection('ws://localhost:8123/api/websocket').then(
  (conn) => {
    console.log('Connection established!');
    subscribeEntities(conn, entities => console.log('New entities!', entities));
  },
  err => console.error('Connection failed with code', err)
)
```

## Usage

### Initializing connection

Connections to the websocket API are initiated by calling `createConnection(url[, options])`. `createConnection` will return a promise that will resolve to either a `Connection` object or rejects with an error code.

#### Available options

Currently the following options are available:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| authToken | Auth token to use to validate with Home Assistant.
| setupRetry | Number of times to retry initial connection when it fails. -1 means infinite.

#### Possible error codes

Currently the following error codes can be expected:

| Error | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| ERR_CANNOT_CONNECT | If the client was unable to connect to the websocket API.
| ERR_INVALID_AUTH | If the supplied authentication was invalid.

You can import them into your code as follows:

```javascript
import { ERR_CANNOT_CONNECT, ERR_INVALID_AUTH } from 'home-assistant-js-websocket';
```

#### Automatic reconnecting

The connection object will automatically try to reconnect to the server when the connection gets lost. On reconnect, it will automatically resubscribe the event listeners.

The `Connection` object implements two events to signal loss of connection and successful reconnect.

| Event | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| ready | Fired when authentication is successful and the connection is ready to take commands.
| disconnected | Fired when the connection is lost.

You can attach and remove listeners as follows:

```javascript
function eventHandler() {
  console.log('Connection has been established again');
}

conn.addEventListener('ready', eventHandler);
conn.removeEventListener('ready', eventHandler);
```

### Entities

You can subscribe to the entities of Home Assistant. Your callback will be called when the entities are first loaded and on every change after that.

The function `subscribeEntities` will return a promise that resolves to an unsubscribe function.

```javascript
import { subscribeEntities } from 'home-assistant-js-websocket';

// conn is the connection from earlier.

subscribeEntities(conn, entities => console.log('New entities!', entities));
```

### Config

You can subscribe to the config of Home Assistant. Config can change when either a component gets loaded or a new service gets registered.

The function `subscribeConfig` will return a promise that resolves to an unsubscribe function.

```javascript
import { subscribeConfig } from 'home-assistant-js-websocket';

// conn is the connection from earlier.

subscribeConfig(conn, config => console.log('New config!', config));
```

### Managing entities

A few helper methods are included to help display the returned entities.

#### getGroupEntities(entities, group)

Returns an object with only the entities referenced by `group`.

#### splitByGroups(entities)

Split `entities` into the groups that are contained in `entities` and a collection of entities that do not belong to a group. Groups will be returned sorted by order.

```json5
{
  groups: [
    { entity_id: 'group.example_1', state: … },
    { entity_id: 'group.example_2', state: … },
  ],
  ungrouped: {
    'sensor.temperature': { entity_id: … },
    'sensor.humidity': { entity_id: … },
  }
}
```

#### getViewEntities(entities, view)

Returns an object containing all the entities from `entities` that are needed to render this view.

#### extractViews(entities)

Returns an ordered list of available views in `entities`.

#### extractDomain(entityId)

Returns the domain of `entityId`.

```javascript
extractDomain('light.kitchen')  # 'light'
```

#### extractObjectId(entityId)

Returns the object id of `entityId`.

```javascript
extractObjectId('light.kitchen')  # 'kitchen'
```

## Connection API Reference

##### `conn.getStates()`

Get the state of all entities. Returns a promise that will resolve to the result of querying the server for all the states.

##### `conn.getServices()`

Get all available services. Returns a promise that will resolve to the result of querying the server for all the services.

##### `conn.getPanels()`

Get the Home Assistant panel config. Returns a promise that will resolve to the result of querying the server for all the panels config.

##### `conn.getConfig()`

Get the Home Assistant server config. Returns a promise that will resolve to the result of querying the server for all the config.

##### `conn.callService(domain, service[, serviceData])`

Call a service within Home Assistant. Returns a promise that will resolve when the service has been called successfully.

##### `conn.subscribeEvents(eventCallback[, eventType])`

Subscribe to all or specific events on the Home Assistant bus. Calls `eventCallback` for each event that gets received.

Returns a promise that will resolve to a function that will cancel the subscription once called.

##### `conn.addEventListener(eventType, listener)`

Listen for events on the connection. [See docs.](#automatic-reconnecting)
